# oni-demo
Download a demo version of Open Network Insight, which can be run standalone on a windows laptop using Winpython https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/latest/download 


[Instructions for downloading and running the demo] 

We use a portable version of python that has all the dependencies and stuff included, you need to download and run this first: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/latest/download 

Install it in the root directory as C:\winpython to avoid any awkwardness in file path references. 

You want to unzip oni-demo-win.zip into the winpython/notebooks folder 

Run the shortcut "Jupyter Notebook.exe"ù  in the WinPython folder.

When you start the notebook server (above), you can access these two links:

http://localhost:8888/files/oni-demo-win/index_sconnects.html

http://localhost:8888/files/oni-demo-win/storyboard_sconnect.html
